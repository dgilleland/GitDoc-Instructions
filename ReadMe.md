# Using GitDoc

This repo contains [instructions for using GitDoc](./GitDocUsage.md) along with the settings that can be copied into any repo for marked assignments. Simply copy the contents of this repo (except this `ReadMe.md` and related `.gitignore`/`.gitattributes` files) into your student repository or repository template.

> *Note: Your existing `.gitignore` settings for your student/template repository may be set to ignore the `.vscode/settings.json` and/or `.vscode/extensions.json` files, in which case you may need to perform a force-add (`git add -f .vscode`) in order to include them.
